# ESPHome based dashboard using Lilygo T5 4,7" e-ink display + ESP32

![Sample](/sample.png)

This is my hobby project to create an information-dense kitchen countertop dashboard for my Home Assistant based smart home.

My work was inspired by geekuillaume, Plawasan, and Tolnai.

Disclaimer: I am a hack. ðŸ™‚

## Device

I used a LILYGO T5-4.7 inch E-Paper ESP32 V3 Version 16MB Flash 8MB PSRAM WiFi/Bluetooth for arduino 18650 Battery Holder Version ordered from Amazon.

## Getting started

Steps I needed to get this project up and running on Windows:

- install ESPHome addon and integration to Home Assistant
- follow the [ESPHome CLI guide](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_command_line.html)
- add passwords to `secrets.yaml` (not pushed to this repo)

## Custom solutions behind

My dashboard code may not be reusable directly for anyone else, but it might give some ideas, or perhaps a motivation that it is not that difficult to just create something like this from scratch. The layout is fully custom and tailored for my own needs. I tried to produce just a little bit better code than a 5 year old would do, but I'm not that proud of it (could use a lot of refactoring). Oh boy, I haven't used C++ in ages... ðŸ™‚

Date related things and some other stuff are localized in a perhaps ugly way, since strftime can't do that.

Data sources used behind:

- HA date and time
- `sun` and `moon` HA sensors
- google calendar to get today's Sunrise and Sunset
- 433 MHz temperature+humidity sensors, Accuweather Atlas weather station
- Another ESP32 monitoring garage door positions
- Motion messages from Home Security Camera using MQTT (Blue Iris)
- Fireplace monitoring (icon for Living Room temperature) monitoring Shelly state
- Freezer power monitored by Shelly presence using Unifi integration. Shelly for porch lights on same GFCI circuit as freezer (happy coincidence).
- Accuweather integration for forecasts
  - Required creation of 3 forecast condition entities to pass to ESPHome: 
    "{{ state_attr('weather.home', 'forecast')[0/1/2].condition }}"
  - Entitities of Min/Max "Real Feel" temperatures for 0/1/2 days out made by integration

## To Do

Things I still want to clean up:

- Status icon and text positioning (alignment and orientation is boggling my mind)
- Possible clean up Sunrise/Sunset information by trimming to just times and show icons
  - Need value template like: 
    {{ state_attr('calendar.sunrise_and_sunset_for_bristol', 'message').split(",")[0].replace('Sunrise: ','') }}
- Squeeze in rain probability to forecast while keeping hourly/day/week rain totals?
  - Would require more custom templates like: 
    "{{ state_attr('weather.home', 'forecast')[0/1/2].precipitation_probability }}"
